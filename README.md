At some point my friend Gavin invented "a silly little math game," the rules of which are as follows:

It's very simple - everyone has the numbers from 2 to 27 available to them for one use. Each round, the lower number wins a point unless it divides evenly into the higher number, in which case the higher number wins a point. Ties are half a point each. Game ends after 26 rounds when all numbers have been used.

This repo will be a collection of efforts to machine learn this game
